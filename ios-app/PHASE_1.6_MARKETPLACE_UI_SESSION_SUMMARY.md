## Testing Status

### Manual Testing Required
- [ ] View marketplace listings
- [ ] Filter listings (5 filters)
- [ ] View listing details
- [ ] List NFT with native payment
- [ ] List NFT with ERC-20 payment
- [ ] Buy NFT with native payment
- [ ] Buy NFT with ERC-20 payment
- [ ] Make offer with expiration
- [ ] Accept offer as seller
- [ ] Cancel listing
- [ ] Cancel offer
- [ ] Gas estimation accuracy
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Loading states
- [ ] Pull-to-refresh

### Edge Cases to Test
- [ ] Empty marketplace
- [ ] No NFTs to list
- [ ] No tokens for ERC-20
- [ ] Expired offers
- [ ] Sold listings
- [ ] Canceled listings
- [ ] Network failures
- [ ] Transaction failures
- [ ] Insufficient balance
- [ ] Invalid price inputs

---

## Known Limitations

1. **No Search**: Cannot search by NFT name/collection
2. **No Sorting**: Cannot sort by price, date, etc.
3. **No Pagination**: All listings loaded at once
4. **Placeholder USD**: No real price oracle integration
5. **Single Gateway**: IPFS uses single gateway (ipfs.io)
6. **Manual Addition**: NFTs must be added manually
7. **Limited Caching**: AsyncImage has basic caching only
