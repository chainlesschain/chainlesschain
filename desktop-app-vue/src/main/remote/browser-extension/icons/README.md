# Extension Icons

Place your extension icons here:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## Generating Icons

You can use any image editor or online tool to create these icons.
Recommended: Use a square image with the ChainlessChain logo.

## Temporary Placeholder

If icons are missing, the extension will still work but without visual icons.
