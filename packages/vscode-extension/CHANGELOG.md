# Changelog — ChainlessChain IDE Bridge (VS Code)

All notable changes to this extension are documented here.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-10

Initial release. Bridges the ChainlessChain `cc` agent CLI to VS Code.

- Localhost MCP server (Streamable HTTP + bearer auth) advertised via a lockfile
  (`~/.chainlesschain/ide/<port>.json`) and integrated-terminal env vars
  (`CHAINLESSCHAIN_IDE_PORT` / `CHAINLESSCHAIN_IDE_TOKEN`).
- Four tools exposed to the agent as `mcp__ide__*`: `getSelection`,
  `getDiagnostics`, `getOpenEditors`, `openDiff`.
- `openDiff` opens a native diff with an editable proposal pane and blocks until
  the user accepts (applies the change) or rejects.
- Commands: *Show Bridge Status*, *Restart Bridge*; setting
  `chainlesschain.ide.enabled`.
