# JetBrains glue — VS Code parity status

The IntelliJ-SDK glue that wires the pure layers
(`com.chainlesschain.ide.{ConversationManager,PreviewDetect,MultiDiff,Mentions,
SessionArgs,IntrospectArgs}`) into visible features. **Sections 1–6 are now
implemented and build-verified** (0.4.0).

> ✅ **CORRECTION (2026-06-16):** the earlier "can't build on Windows" assumption
> was wrong. `./gradlew.bat buildPlugin` builds fine on the Windows box with
> `JAVA_HOME` = Eclipse Adoptium **JDK 17** (the IntelliJ 2024.2 SDK downloads on
> first run, ~1 GB; rebuilds are cached). The pure layers smoke-test with
> `javac --release 8 -encoding UTF-8` (**must** pass `-encoding UTF-8` — raw javac
> defaults to GBK on Windows and chokes on the `—`/`…` in comments).

> ⚠️ **Still SDK-gated for VERIFICATION, not building.** Per the dead-panel lesson
> (0.9.0/0.10.0, [[feedback_full_test_pyramid_before_publish]]), every UI piece
> must be exercised in a `./gradlew runIde` sandbox before publish — compilation
> alone does not prove the panels render. That manual GUI pass is the remaining
> gate (a headless agent can build but cannot click through the sandbox).

## ✅ Landed glue (build-verified, 0.4.0)

- [x] **§1 Conversation tabs** — `JBTabbedPane` of `ConversationView`s, one live
      child per tab, `+ New chat` / per-tab `×` / instant switch / per-tab resume
      ids in `PropertiesComponent` (migrates the legacy single key).
- [x] **§2 App Preview** — `PreviewService` spawns `npm run <devScript>`
      (`PreviewDetect.pickDevScript`), detects the URL (`detectServerUrl`), embeds
      `JBCefBrowser` (external-browser fallback) in a new preview tool window;
      Start/Stop actions; stop kills the process tree.
- [x] **§3 Inline diff "Request changes…"** — `openDiff` is Accept / Request
      changes… / Reject; returns `{outcome:"changes-requested", comments, reviewedText}`.
- [x] **§4 Batch multi-file diff** — `openMultiDiff` (EditorFacade + IntelliJ impl +
      `IdeTools` tool → `mcp__ide__openMultiDiff`): `SimpleDiffRequestChain` +
      Accept all / Choose files… (`MultiDiff.fileLabel` checkboxes) / Reject.
- [x] **§5 Selection actions + @file ref** — editor-popup Explain / Refactor
      (seed `@selection`); Insert File Reference (`Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+K`) → `@path#L<a>-<b>`
      via the new pure `Mentions.formatInsertReference`. Panel slash commands
      `/new /stop /cost /context /help`.
- [x] **§6 VS Code 0.30.0 parity** — approval-mode `/auto·/bypass·/normal` +
      extended-thinking `/think·/ultrathink·/think-off` (spawn-time restart),
      context-window indicator (`IntrospectArgs` + `AgentChatSession.runCapture`),
      new (`Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+N`) / reopen-closed (`Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+T`) actions.

## ⏳ Remaining polish (lower-value, not blocking 0.4.0)

- [ ] **@-mention completion popup** — `Mentions.filterFiles` /
      `formatSymbolItems` are ported; still need to wire a completion popup on the
      input field + a PSI symbol search (`GotoSymbolModel`/`ChooseByNameContributor`).
      Today you type `@path` manually (or use Insert File Reference).
- [ ] **Interactive plan / approval cards** — plan + approval events currently
      render as text lines (`📋 plan …`, `ℹ approval …`); VS Code shows
      Approve/Reject buttons. Functional as-is; buttons are an enhancement.

## Publish — ⚠️ the required final step (held on runIde verification)

The glue is implemented + build-verified, version bumped to **0.4.0**, CHANGELOG
written. **Before publishing**, in an environment that can drive a GUI:

- [ ] `./gradlew runIde` → exercise each feature (tabs, slash commands, selection
      actions, diff review, multi-file diff, preview) in the sandbox IDE.
- [ ] Then **publish (required, not optional)**: tag `ide-jetbrains-v0.4.0` →
      CI `.github/workflows/ide-extensions.yml` JetBrains job `publishPlugin` with
      `JETBRAINS_PUBLISH_TOKEN` (currently live on the Marketplace: **0.3.3**).
- [ ] Sync the 官网 ide page / README to the 0.4.0 features (mirror VS Code copy).
